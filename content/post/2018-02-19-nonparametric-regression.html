<p>Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.</p>
<p>Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how ‘rough’ or ‘wiggly’ the curve <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is. An intuitively way is <span class="math inline">\(\int _a ^b \{g&#39;&#39;(t)\}^2dt\)</span>,the integrated squared second derivative.</p>
<p>The general form of penalized least squares regression
<span class="math display">\[S(g)=\sum^n_{i=1}\{Y_i-g(t_i)\}^2+a\int^b_a\{g&#39;&#39;(x)^2\}dx\]</span>
So the fit is not only concern about the goodness of fit(if so,1-NN is the best method among all methods for the data set), but also consider about the roughness.
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is ‘rate of exchange’, or weight of penalty. Minimizing <span class="math inline">\(S(g)\)</span> is the best compromise between smoothness and goodness-of-fit for a given <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is large-&gt;more weighted on smoothness,<span class="math inline">\(\hat g\)</span> would be curvature. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> -&gt; 0, the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is relative small,then the square sum would be the main contribution to <span class="math inline">\(S(g)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat g\)</span> will approach the interpolating curve.</p>
<p>Semiparametric model
<span class="math display">\[
Y=g(t)+x^T\beta+error
\]</span></p>

<p>Following is review and notes for Green and B.W. Silverman(1994),Nonparametric Regression and Generalized Linear Models: A roughness penalty approach. The paragraph upon actually from the chap1 but only some main ideas.</p>
<div id="chapter-2.-interpolating-smoothing-splines." class="section level3">
<h3>Chapter 2. Interpolating &amp; smoothing splines.</h3>
<p>Main goal: How to find a curve g to minimize <span class="math inline">\(S(g)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A pivotal role: cubic splines.</p>
<p>Some basic notations:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t_1,...t_n\)</span> is knots in <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;t_1&lt;...&lt;t_n&lt;b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cubic spline g is</p>
<ul>
<li>cubic polynomial in <span class="math inline">\((a,t_1),(t_1,t_2),....,(t_n.b)\)</span></li>
<li>The polynomial pieces fit together at the points <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>. (<span class="math inline">\(g,g&#39;,g&#39;&#39;\)</span> agrees at <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many equivalent ways of specifying a cubic spline. One is
<span class="math display">\[
g(t)=d_i(t-t_i)^3+c_i(t-t_i)^2+b_i(t-t_i)+a_i,\ for\ t_i\leq t \leq t_{i+1}
\]</span>
for given constant <span class="math inline">\(a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i,i=0,...,n\)</span>,define $t_0=a,t_{i+1}=b $;
This is the intuitive about the “piecewise cubic polynomial”.</p>
<p>Definition: Natural cubic spline(NCS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Its second and third derivatives are zero at a and b.</li>
</ul>
<p>This condition called natural boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Imply <span class="math inline">\(d_0=c_0=d_n=c_n=0\)</span>-&gt; g is linear on <span class="math inline">\([a,t_1],[t_n,b]\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>Comment</del>:(Failed)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><del>It contains 4(n+2) parameters. As the cubic spline definition, the “<span class="math inline">\(g,g&#39;,g&#39;&#39;\)</span> agrees at <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span>.”,will have 3(n+1) constrains.The nature spline will add 4 constrains. For interpolating problem, interpolate means <span class="math inline">\(g(t_i)=z_i\)</span> than another n+2 constrains.Then totally it is 4n+9 constrains. Is the solution always exist?</del>
Maybe I should find the answer from Tibshirani and Hastie(2004), because the way I thought is from it.</p></li>
<li><p><del>Deep thinking: g agrees at <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(g(t_i)=z_i\)</span> condition? than there are less n constrains.It is only 3n+8 constrains.</del></p></li>
<li><p>Is the choosing knots the same as interpolating the known knots? (It should be same I think.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>2.2.1 The value-second derivative representation</h5>
<p>This is another way to representation NCS, by its value and its second derivative at each knots.</p>
<p>Notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g_i=g(t_i)\ and\ \gamma_i=g&#39;&#39;(t_i)\ for\ i=1,...,n

<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g}=(g_1,...,g_n)^T,\mathbf{\gamma}=(\gamma_1,...,\gamma_n)^T\)</span>. Author assert <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{\gamma}\)</span> specify the g completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>comment:(Failed)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As the comment before, if it only contains 3n+6 constrains, then give extra information in <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;&#39;\)</span>, it would have extra n constrains,than totally 4n+8 constrains. Than if it has solution, it should be unique.</p></li>
<li><p>Back to begging for count: n+2 constrains for value <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span>,4 nature boundary conditions,n constrains for <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;&#39;\)</span>,n constrains for agree <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, not meet the 4n+8 parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Think in a nother way, the linear system. We have n+2 cubic polynomials, each polynomials have 4 parameters. Two value of polynomials, the tail and the head: two constrains. The tail and head 2-derivatives: two constrains. Tail and head 1-derivatives: agree or 0: another 2 constrains. Then there are 6 constrains for 4 parameters.Ofc some a degenerate, but how to count in this way? Refer to ESL again.</p></li>

<p>The neccesaary and sufficient condition for the vectors genuinely to represent a natural cubic spline on the given knot sequence.</p>
<p>Definition:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(h_i=t_{i+1}-t_i\)</span>, Q is <span class="math inline">\(n\times (n-2)\)</span> band matrices with entries as
<span class="math display">\[
q_{j-1,j}=h^{-1}_{j-1},q_{jj}=-h^{-1}_{j-1}-h^{-1}_{j}, q_{j+1}=h^{-1}_j
\]</span>
others are zero, <span class="math inline">\(q_{ij}=0,if\ |i-j|\geq2\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(i=1,...,n.j=2,...,n-1\)</span>.
Band matrices R is <span class="math inline">\((n-2)\times(n-2)\)</span>,given by
<span class="math display">\[
r_ii=\frac{1}{3} (h_{i-1}+h_i)\\
r_{i,i+1}=r_{i+1,i}=\frac{1}{6}h_i.
\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(i=2,...,n-1\)</span>,$r_{ij}=0 for |i-j|2. $</p>
<p>Property: R is strictly diagonal dominant: <span class="math inline">\(|r_{ii}|&gt;\sum_{i\neq j}|r_{ij}|\)</span>. R is strictly positive-definite.
btw: Q is three-wide
Define:
<span class="math display">\[K=QR^{-1}Q^T\]</span>
Then we have the theorem:</p>
<p>Theorem:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\gamma}\)</span> specify a natural cubic spline iff <span class="math inline">\(Q^T\mathbf{g}=R\gamma\)</span>.
Then the roughness penalty will satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\int ^b_a g&#39;&#39;(t)dt=\gamma^TR\gamma=\mathbf{g}^TK\mathbf{g}\)</span></p>

<div id="interpolating-spline" class="section level5">
<h5>2.2 Interpolating spline</h5>
<p>Goal: Main part in smoothing, but interpolating can simplify and clarify subsequent discussion of the smoothing problem.</p>
<p>Interpolating :<span class="math inline">\(z_1,...,z_2 \rightarrow t_1,...t_n\)</span>. We have <span class="math inline">\(g(t_i)=z_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just straight line.</li>
<li>Smoothing curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the straight line if not fit what we want, we than discussing about the smoothing curve.</p>
<p>Then the workflow in below is</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define the “Smooth”</li>
<li>Goal: Smoothest</li>
<li>NCS is smoothest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do this:</p>
<p>The smoothing curve for interpolating is not unique, in this way, we want to find the best one among all the potential curves.
If we want the best one, we need define what the meaning of best, then we need define “Smooth”.</p>
<p>First, we define the working space as all the function with two continuous derivatives in domain <span class="math inline">\([a,b]\)</span>, called <span class="math inline">\(S[a,b]\)</span>. Then we need to find which one is best in <span class="math inline">\(S[a,b]\)</span>.
Back to the beginning of this document, the intuitively definition of smoothness is <span class="math inline">\(\int _a ^b g&#39;&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>A result showed that natural cubic spline interpolating minimums the <span class="math inline">\(\int _a ^b g&#39;&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>The next questions is</p>
<ul>
<li>why NCS is smoothest?</li>
<li>Is the NCS interpolating unique?</li>
<li>How to calculate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s ask the second question first.</p>
<p>Theorem:</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 2\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(t_1&lt;...&lt;t_n\)</span> with given <span class="math inline">\(z_1,...,z_n\)</span>, there is a unique natural cubic spine <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> with knots at the point <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(g(t_i)=z_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,...,n\)</span>.</p>
<p>proof:</p>
<p>By theorem before, the sufficient and neccessary condition for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g},\gamma\)</span> specify a NCS. Then the condition specify <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g}\)</span>, the free parameter is <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, so if there exist a unique <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to meet the condition, then proofed.
Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> is strictly positive-definite, there will be aunique <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=R^{-1}Q^T\mathbf{g}\)</span>.QED.</p>
<p>The key thing is the previous theorem, but idk yet how to prove that.</p>
<p>Computation discussion:</p>
<p>As the R is band matrix with width of band is 2,a triagonal matrix, we do not need to calculate the <span class="math inline">\(R^{-1}\)</span>, there is a fast and iteravie algorithm to get the answer with O(n). There are also special structure for Q, we also do not need to calculate <span class="math inline">\(Q^T\mathbf{g}\)</span> in the matrix manipulate way, we have
<span class="math display">\[
(Q^T\mathbf{g})_i=\frac{g_{i+1}-g_{i}}{h_i}-\frac{g_i-g_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}}
\]</span>
which is also O(n).</p>
<p>Algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STEP 1</strong> Set <span class="math inline">\(g_i=z_i\)</span> for i=1,…,n.</li>
<li><strong>STEP 2</strong> Set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}=Q^T\mathbf{g}\)</span> and solve <span class="math inline">\(R\gamma=\mathbf{x}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</li>

<h5>2.2.2 Optimality properties of the natural cubic spline interpolant</h5>
<p>This section solves the question 1, Why NCS is smoothest.</p>
<p>Author make a obscure definition to make the completeness in mathematical. Remind the space <span class="math inline">\(S[a,b]\)</span> we defined before, now we turn to a new definition <span class="math inline">\(S_2[a,b]\)</span>.
It is the space of functions that are 1. differnetiable on [a,b] 2. “have absolutely continuous first derivative. That is, g is continuous and differentiable everywhere on [a,b] with derivative g’, and there is an integrable function <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;&#39;\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\int _a ^xg&#39;&#39;(t)dt=g&#39;(x)-g&#39;(a)\)</span> for all x in [a,b]”.(Full quote P16 paragraph 3).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_2[a,b]\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(S[a,b]\)</span>, then g is smoothest in <span class="math inline">\(S_2[a,b]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Theorem 2.3</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\widetilde g \in S_2[a,b]\)</span> is an intepolating for <span class="math inline">\((t_i,z_i)\)</span>. g is NCS.
Then <span class="math inline">\(\int \widetilde g&#39;&#39;^2 \geq g&#39;&#39;^2\)</span>, equality hold only if <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are identical.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(h\in S_2[a,b]\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(h=\widetilde g-g\)</span>.
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\int _a^b\widetilde g&#39;&#39;^2 &amp;=\int_a^b(g&#39;&#39;+h&#39;&#39;)^2=\int _a^b g&#39;&#39;^2+2g&#39;&#39;h&#39;&#39;+h&#39;&#39;^2\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
Then we need deal with the interact term.
We have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\int _a ^b g&#39;&#39;(t)h&#39;&#39;(t)dt&amp;=-\int _a ^b g&#39;&#39;&#39;(t)h&#39;(t)dt\\
&amp;=-\sum _{j=1}^{n-1} g&#39;&#39;&#39;(t^+_j)\int _{t_{j}}^{t_{j+1}}h&#39;(t)dt\\
&amp;=-\sum _{j=1}^{n-1} g&#39;&#39;&#39;(t_j^+)\{h(t_{j+1})-h(t_j)\}=0
\end{align}
\]</span>
Then the interact term is 0. We have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\int _a^b\widetilde g&#39;&#39;^2 &amp;=\int_a^bg&#39;&#39;^2+\int _a^bh&#39;&#39;^2\geq \int _a ^b g&#39;&#39;^2\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
QED.</p>
<p>Advantage of NCS: neatly expressed and intuitively attractive minimization, can be calculated in linear time and stored easily as a piecewise polynomial. Not limited by the knots choosen and spline structure itself.</p>
