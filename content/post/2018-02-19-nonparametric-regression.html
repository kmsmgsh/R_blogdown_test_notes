<p>Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.</p>
<p>Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how ‘rough’ or ‘wiggly’ the curve <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is. An intuitively way is <span class="math inline">\(\int _a ^b \{g&#39;&#39;(t)\}^2dt\)</span>,the integrated squared second derivative.</p>
