Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.

Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how 'rough' or 'wiggly' the curve $g$ is. An intuitively way is $\int _a ^b \{g''(t)\}^2dt$,the integrated squared second derivative.
