Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.

Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how 'rough' or 'wiggly' the curve $g$ is. An intuitively way is $\int _a ^b \{g''(t)\}^2dt$,the integrated squared second derivative.

The general form of penalized least squares regression
$$S(g)=\sum^n_{i=1}\{Y_i-g(t_i)\}^2+a\int^b_a\{g''(x)^2\}dx$$
So the fit is not only concern about the goodness of fit(1-NN is the best among the data set), but also consider about the roughness.
$\alpha$ is the 'rate of exchange', or the weight of penalty.
