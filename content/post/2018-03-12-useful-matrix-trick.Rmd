This is found by  Chapter "the multivariate Normal distribution"" by T.W. Anderson(1984),"An Introduction to Multivariate Analysis".P18 (31).
The
$$
\begin{aligned}
&E(DZE+F)\\
&=(\sum _{h,g} d_{ih}Z_{hg}e_{gj}+f_{ij})=\sum_{h,g}d_{ih}(EZ_{h,g})e_{gj}+f_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$
It may useful to mark $DZE$ is $\sum _{h,g} d_{ih}Z_{hg}e_{gj}$, maybe can make quadratic form more handleable.
