      <description>This is just to make the position. The downloaded version of the &amp;ldquo;Classification and Regression Trees&amp;rdquo; is very not clear. So I try to borrow one from university library. Then I will write some notes about this book here. This may not be fulfill very quick, but I hope so. Maybe this will be the first time to use the feature of r markdown, the package &amp;ldquo;rparts&amp;rdquo; description is implementing the algorithms in that book.</description>

      <title>Natural cubic spline for Non-parametric regression</title>

      <description>Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.
Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how ‘rough’ or ‘wiggly’ the curve \(g\) is. An intuitively way is \(\int _a ^b \{g&amp;#39;&amp;#39;(t)\}^2dt\),the integrated squared second derivative.
The general form of penalized least squares regression \[S(g)=\sum^n_{i=1}\{Y_i-g(t_i)\}^2+a\int^b_a\{g&amp;#39;&amp;#39;(x)^2\}dx\] So the fit is not only concern about the goodness of fit(if so,1-NN is the best method among all methods for the data set), but also consider about the roughness.</description>

      <description>This is the first page by r markdown, and it is only a simple markdown now.
