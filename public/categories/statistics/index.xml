      <description>Copy the book. e-version(rather than pen version—&amp;gt; can’t be used by search tools (ctrl+f)).
goal: find the distribution of the sample correlation coefficient when the population coefficient is different from zero.(The case is zero discussed in the previous chapter, and derive the distribution, construct the hypothesis test based on the distribution) First thing we should do is derive the joint density of \(a_{11},a_{12},a_{22}\). In previous section, we saw that conditional on \(v_1\) held fixed, the random variable \(b=\frac{a_{12}}{a_{11}}\) and \(U/\sigma^2=(a_{22}-a^2_{12}/a_{11})/\sigma^2\) are distributed independently according to \(N(\beta,\sigma^2/c^2)\) and the \(\chi^2\) distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom, respectively.</description>

      <description>Notes for Classification and regression trees(Leo Breima,Jerome H.Friedman, Richard A. Olshen, Charles J.Stone,1984)
###Chap1 The back ground.
1.1 Classifiers as partitions
The classification problem is with a long history and real world background, such as the medical diagnosis problem. We make some measurements on some case or object then predict which class the case is in. Then the book describe 3 examples. The first one is the analysis of a complex chemical compound by analysis its mass spectra.</description>

      <description>This is just to make the position. The downloaded version of the &amp;ldquo;Classification and Regression Trees&amp;rdquo; is very not clear. So I try to borrow one from university library. Then I will write some notes about this book here. This may not be fulfill very quick, but I hope so. Maybe this will be the first time to use the feature of r markdown, the package &amp;ldquo;rparts&amp;rdquo; description is implementing the algorithms in that book.</description>

      <title>Natural cubic spline for Non-parametric regression</title>

      <description>Here is the a new note about the non-parametric regression.
Quote from the Green and Silverman(1994),1.2.2, there are many ways to quantify the roughness of a curve, which is means the how ‘rough’ or ‘wiggly’ the curve \(g\) is. An intuitively way is \(\int _a ^b \{g&amp;#39;&amp;#39;(t)\}^2dt\),the integrated squared second derivative.
The general form of penalized least squares regression \[S(g)=\sum^n_{i=1}\{Y_i-g(t_i)\}^2+a\int^b_a\{g&amp;#39;&amp;#39;(x)^2\}dx\] So the fit is not only concern about the goodness of fit(if so,1-NN is the best method among all methods for the data set), but also consider about the roughness.</description>
